# What I Learned from My First Data Project

Starting out, data felt overwhelming. But I learned the power of:
- Breaking down messy data
- Using SQL transactions wisely
- Presenting findings clearly (especially to non-technical people)

This project showed me I don’t need to know it all—just keep learning, building, and improving.
